## Work Experience
**AI Engineer Intern @ Kernel International Ltd (_May 2024 - September 2024_)**
- Collaborated on the **Medibee** project to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for a medical study assistant chatbot.  
- Split medical textbook content into chunks, generated embeddings, and stored them in **ChromaDB** and **MongoDB** vector stores for efficient semantic search.  
- Designed and implemented a **NoSQL-based topic management system** to structure and retrieve medical topics and subtopics effectively.  
- Integrated multiple **LLMs (GPT-4, LLAMA, Gemini)** into the chatbot system using **LangChain**, enabling contextual responses to complex medical queries.  
- Applied prompt engineering to **generate, evaluate, and refine** multiple-choice questions from retrieved context for student learning enhancement.  
- Utilized **LangGraph** for workflow visualization

## Projects
### BDTSD-YOLO for Bangldeshi Traffic Sign Detection

In this work, A new block was propsed in MHAF-YOLO **a dual‑path C3‑style module** that serves as the core of BDTSD‑YOLO. I along with a team of 3 members designed the block by splitting the input feature map into two parallel branches: one follows a lightweight bottleneck pathway to preserve fine spatial details, while the other performs deeper convolutional operations to capture richer semantic features. These branches are then concatenated and passed through a final 1×1 convolution. This was integrated into the already built **MHAF-YOLO**  using **PyTorch**. This design enhances the model’s ability to detect small and distant Bangladeshi traffic signs more accurately by balancing spatial precision with semantic depth.

### The Red Owl - Connect IUTians Worldwide GitHub Link
[Github](https://github.com/Samin-Sadaf7/TheRedOwl.git)

In this project, I engineered a full-stack web platform using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **React.js** to connect IUT students, teachers, and alumni. I implemented core features such as user profile creation, secure authentication, and email verification. Additionally, I built an advanced search system with dynamic filters for profiles, events, and blog posts—enhancing user engagement and streamlining access to relevant content within the community.

### Rong - An Event Management Platform
[Github](https://github.com/Samin-Sadaf7/Rong---An-event-management-system.git)

On a three‑person team, I helped create an **event‑management website**. I designed the customer profiles with email verification and ticket‑booking functionality, added a customer review section for post‑event feedback, and integrated secure payments by building the checkout flow with the **Stripe API**. The frontend was done using **React JS**, backend was done using **Express JS**, and as a database **MongoDB** was integrated.

### Collborative ChatGPT- Group Study with AI assistant

Using **FastAPI**, and **MongoDB**, I developed a **collaborative tool powered by ChatGPT** to streamline and enhance user‑AI interaction. The platform includes intelligent error categorization and automatic response correction, enabling users to identify and refine inaccurate outputs. I also integrated the **ChatGPT API** to support iterative feedback loops, facilitating continuous improvement of AI-generated responses in real-time.
