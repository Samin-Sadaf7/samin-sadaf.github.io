## Work Experience
**AI Engineer Intern @ Kernel International Ltd (_May 2024 - September 2024_)**
- Collaborated on the **Medibee** project to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for a medical study assistant chatbot.  
- Split medical textbook content into chunks, generated embeddings, and stored them in **ChromaDB** and **MongoDB** vector stores for efficient semantic search.  
- Designed and implemented a **NoSQL-based topic management system** to structure and retrieve medical topics and subtopics effectively.  
- Integrated multiple **LLMs (GPT-4, LLAMA, Gemini)** into the chatbot system using **LangChain**, enabling contextual responses to complex medical queries.  
- Applied prompt engineering to **generate, evaluate, and refine** multiple-choice questions from retrieved context for student learning enhancement.  
- Utilized **LangGraph** for workflow visualization and **LangServe** for deploying the RAG system as an API service.  
- Contributed to backend enhancements using **Python**, **Unstructured Library**, and **Ollama** for document parsing and model integration.  


## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
