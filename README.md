## Work Experience
**AI Engineer Intern @ Kernel International Ltd (_May 2024 - September 2024_)**
- Collaborated on the **Medibee** project to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for a medical study assistant chatbot.  
- Split medical textbook content into chunks, generated embeddings, and stored them in **ChromaDB** and **MongoDB** vector stores for efficient semantic search.  
- Designed and implemented a **NoSQL-based topic management system** to structure and retrieve medical topics and subtopics effectively.  
- Integrated multiple **LLMs (GPT-4, LLAMA, Gemini)** into the chatbot system using **LangChain**, enabling contextual responses to complex medical queries.  
- Applied prompt engineering to **generate, evaluate, and refine** multiple-choice questions from retrieved context for student learning enhancement.  
- Utilized **LangGraph** for workflow visualization

## Projects
### BDTSD-YOLO for Bangldeshi Traffic Sign Detection
Pytorch, Ultralytics

In this work, A new block was propsed in MHAF-YOLO **a dual‑path C3‑style module** that serves as the core of BDTSD‑YOLO. I along with a team of 3 members designed the block by splitting the input feature map into two parallel branches: one follows a lightweight bottleneck pathway to preserve fine spatial details, while the other performs deeper convolutional operations to capture richer semantic features. These branches are then concatenated and passed through a final 1×1 convolution. This was integrated into the already built **MHAF-YOLO**  using **PyTorch**. This design enhances the model’s ability to detect small and distant Bangladeshi traffic signs more accurately by balancing spatial precision with semantic depth.

### The Red Owl - Connect IUTians Worldwide GitHub Link
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React.js
[Github](https://github.com/Samin-Sadaf7/TheRedOwl.git)

In this project, I developed key features including user profile creation, authentication, and email verification. I also implemented a robust search system with advanced filters to help users easily navigate profiles, events, and blog posts, fostering a dynamic and connected community.

### Rong - An Event Management Platform
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React.js
[Github](https://github.com/Samin-Sadaf7/Rong---An-event-management-system.git)

On a three‑person team, I helped create an **event‑management website**. I implemented customer profiles with email verification and ticket‑booking functionality, added a customer review section for post‑event feedback, and integrated secure payments by building the checkout flow with the **Stripe API**.

### Collborative ChatGPT- Group Study with AI assistant
Python, FastAPI, Next Js, MongoDB 

I developed a **collaborative tool powered by ChatGPT** to enhance user‑AI interaction. The system features error categorization and automatic response correction, allowing users to identify and refine inaccurate outputs. I also integrated the **ChatGPT API** to enable iterative feedback loops for continuous model improvement.
